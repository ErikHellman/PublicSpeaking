**Title:** Cross-Platform development with Progressive Web Apps

**Abstract:**

After more than 10 years of building apps for Android and iOS, we’ve seen multiple attempts at building cross-platform applications. The promise of “write once, run everywhere” has never truly delivered. With the emergence of full support for Progressive Web Apps, we’re naturally suspicious of it being a viable solution. 

In this presentation we will learn what Progressive Web Apps really is, how to build them and, most importantly, when not to use the technology. Maybe you don’t really need an app for everything?
