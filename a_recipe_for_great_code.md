**Title:** A recipe for great code

**Abstract:**

For as long as we have had programming languages, we have also struggled with the best way to write code. In the beginning, we struggled with writing code that executed fast, but it was often hard to read for others. Once computers became faster and had more memory, we could create languages that made it easier to write fast running code as well as something that was easier to read. 

Over the last two decades, we've seen a continuous improvement in programming languages, compilers, tools and IDEs that lets developers focus more on their primary task than how the code gets executed. Despite this, we still struggle with writing good code that not only can be easily tested but also later read by other developers. 

In this session, we will explore the history of how languages, compilers and tools have evolved and look at how we can make coding accessible to everyone. 

Come and learn how to write great code that both runs fast and is easy to read. Expect lots of code samples in both old and new languages, and learn how writing, cooking and assembling IKEA furniture can teach us how to become better at programming.
