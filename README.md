# PublicSpeaking

This repository is inspired from [a similar one](https://github.com/hitherejoe/PublicSpeaking) by [Joe Birch](https://twitter.com/hitherejoe). It contains most of the abstracts for talks that I've planned to do or have done (or that was rejected). Feel free to copy these or use them as inspiration!

Do you want me to give a talk at your conference or meetup? Feel free to reach out to me at [@ErikHellman](https://twitter.com/ErikHellman) or why not [create a issue](https://github.com/ErikHellman/PublicSpeaking/issues/new) on this repo? :)
