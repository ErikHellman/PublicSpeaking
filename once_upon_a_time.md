**Title:** Once upon a time…

**Abstract:**

Have you ever wondered why the default size for terminals is 80 columns wide, what a mainframe really is, or why a byte is exactly eight bits? Do you know why Rear Admiral Grace Hopper is still one of the most important people in software engineering? In this talk, we will go all the way back to the late 50’s and learn about the COBOL programming language, mechanical input systems and how they affected the encoding schemes we have to today, and how developers used to write code when they didn’t have text editors. When we’re done, we should all have a better appreciation of the tools we use today and be better prepared to avoid the mistakes made by our predecessors.
