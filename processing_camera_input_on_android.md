**Title:** Processing camera input on Android

**Abstract:**

The Camera2 APIs have been available for developers since Lollipop. Despite this, a lot of libraries that uses the camera for scanning text, barcodes or QR codes uses the legacy Camera APIs. 

In this session we will learn how to use the more advanced Camera2 API for any kind of processing and computer vision. After this session, you'll feel much more confident to implement the camera processing the way you wanted, without having to resort to heavy libraries that rely on the legacy APIs.
