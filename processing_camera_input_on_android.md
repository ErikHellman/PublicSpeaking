**Title:** Processing camera input on Android

**Abstract:**

Processing and analysing images from the camera in an Android application has always been a complicated thing to solve. Despite Google making a big overhaul of the camera APIs with camera2, developers still struggled with even the simplest tasks such as scanning QR-codes or doing text detection.

At Google IO 2019, we got a new library from Google to make our work easier. The new library is called CameraX and significantly simplifies the common tasks we have when working with the camera on Android. In this session we will learn how to use the CameraX API for any kind of processing and computer vision. After this session, you'll feel much more confident to implement the camera processing the way you wanted, without having to resort to heavy libraries that rely on the legacy APIs.
